I always wanted to create a technical blog, but never took the time to do it. 
Recently, I wanted to play with "Jekyll":http://wiki.github.com/mojombo/jekyll, a simple static site generator and just bought a VPS instance on "linode":http://linode.com. So I made the jump and create this blog from a github "fork":http://github.com/jtoy/jtoyblog.

I'm mainly doing some ruby stuff but buying this server was a way to hack a bit with archlinux and learn some basic sysadmin. I hope some of you will find something interesting here, otherwise you can just make fun of my English.
