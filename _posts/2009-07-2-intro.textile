This is my first time writing my own blog. I don't believe I have anything interesting to say, but I will post random thoughts about coding, traveling, and life.  The source code for this blog is also available at "http://github.com/jtoy/blog":github. So currently in my life I am spending a lot of my time programming in ruby, jquery/javascript and Objective-C.  I have also been playing a bit with clojure, but have not had a chance to use it in a real project.   I just recently got my scuba diving license and plan to scua dive as often as I can.  I have also been learning how to sail, that is pretty fun, I think it would be a good idea to one day try sailing around the world, anyone interested in going with me :) ?
