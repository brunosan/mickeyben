I recently was working on a lightbox where I needed to display a remote image and recenter the lighbox once the image is loaded.
This may seems pretty simple but it took me some time to discover that jQuery does the job via the __load__ method. 
As soon as the image has been loaded, the handler is called.

{% highlight javascript %}
  $("#image_id").load(function(){
    // stuff to do after the image is loaded
  });
{% endhighlight %}
