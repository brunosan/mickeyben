"Jekyll":http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. I use it for this blog and the cool part about it is that is very simple and easy to use and there's already plenty of "websites":http://wiki.github.com/mojombo/jekyll/sites using it. 
I forked "jtoy.net":http://github.com/jtoy/jtoyblog/ and was ready to blog in about an hour. 

I didn't use ruby1.9 but 1.8.7 because of some "issues":http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/issues/#issue/108 with pygments.

First if you don't have ruby, let's install it. 
Remove the "ruby" package, so that it doesn't mess up, and retrieve and build the packages with any way you're comfortable with, 

{% highlight bash %}
pacman -R ruby
yaourt -S ruby1.8
yaourt -S rubygems1.8

# ruby1.8 installs ruby-1.8 executable. link it to "ruby":
cd /usr/bin
ln ruby-1.8 ruby -s
{% endhighlight %}

If you need syntax highlighting, you need python and pygments : 

{% highlight bash %}
pacman -S python
{% endhighlight %}

download the last version of easy_install (ruby gems equivalent for python) and install pygments :

{% highlight bash %}
wget http://pypi.python.org/packages/2.6/s/setuptools/setuptools-0.6c11-py2.6.egg
sudo sh setuptools-0.6c11-py2.6.eg
easy_install Pygments
{% endhighlight %}

Install Jekyll :

{% highlight bash %}
sudo gem install jekyll
{% endhighlight %}

Next, if you want the "Related posts" feature, you'll need the the Ruby GSL package.
I first tried to install it via yaourt but it didn't work (conflicts with rubygems), next I try do download the last version (1.10.3) but it didn't work as well ... So I took the last version from the SVN :

{% highlight bash %}
svn checkout svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/rb-gsl
cd rb-gsl/trunk/rb-gsl
ruby setup.rb config
ruby setup.rb setup
sudo ruby setup.rb install
{% endhighlight %}

Finally, this is how I run Jekyll:

{% highlight bash %}
jekyll --pygments --lsi 
{% endhighlight %}

To preview the website you can specify the option __--server__
