Today everyone is looking at Google Buzz, saying it's a game changer or not but.

*It's just a part of the cake.*

This last years, Google released few social products ; Picasa, Groups, Blogger, Orkut, Reader, OpenSocial, Wave ... and own Youtube.
They released Google Profiles (ex: "here":http://www.google.com/profiles/pada51) that is a public page referencing all your links, your photo, in a word : tons of metadatas.

And they recently enabled WebFinger (ex: "here":http://webfingerclient-dclinton.appspot.com/lookup?identifier=pada51%40gmail.com&format=web), a simple API that exposes publicly your metadatas on the net.

Yesterday, Buzz ; to share your status, photos, links and talk about it to your friends and people you want to follow.
Today they bought Aardvark, the social search service.

They now have all the bricks of a huge social network and the thing is that's not only on one website, it's everywhere.
